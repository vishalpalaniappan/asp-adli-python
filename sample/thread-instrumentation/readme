This folder will contain a multi threaded application and will contain the relevant instrumentation. 

I was thinking about this and each thread will be in its own file and it will have its own design specs. Since I defined the abstractions ID's in a hierarchial structure, I can identify the ids in each thread uniquely using this heierarchial structure. Then I can encode messages between threads and create traces that show the communication between processs in multiple threads and observe traces in the design that span multiple threads.

This is similar to the distributed traces that are observed and I think its simpler place to start, so I will start here. This will give me a chance to design a multi threaded application and instrument.
