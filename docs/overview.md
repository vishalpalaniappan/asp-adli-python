# Automating the Management of Software Systems

Software systems are the realization of an intentional design. This means that the relationship between every abstraction in the system is established through the design. The programming language used to implement the design must have the ability to establish the necessary relationships and realize the intention of the design. On a low level, this means being able to implement the mechanical abstractions using control flow, loops etc. On a higher level, it means respecting the semantic rules and relationships by shaping how data and intention is moved between them. Ultimately, the successful operation of a software system hinges on the ability to realize the intentions of its design in the environment that it is operating in.

## Automating Debugging

Debugging a software system is about understanding how the system was unable to realize the intentions of its design and understanding how to realign its reality with its intention. The misalignment can result in a loud failure that ends in an exception or it can simply be the world not being realized as intended. To illustrate this concept, the following sample design is used:

![library-manager]

This design realizes a library manager that provides the user with a menu to interact with it. The user can submit books which are added to a basket. When the user decides to place the books on the shelf, it takes each book from the basket and places it on the shelf using the first letter of the name as the slot. It also provides an option to display the contents of the library and exit the library manager.

Since the world is intentionally designed through the semantic relationships established through the design, a failure to respect these intentions results in predictable failure modalities that can be resolved by realigning the behavior of the design with its intentions. 

At this point, it makes sense to differentiate between mechanical failures and semantic failures. A semantic failure is a failure to realize the intentions of the design and within the intentionally designed world, it has inherent meaning. On the other hand, a mechanical failure is an exception that is generated by the program. While it identifies all the mechanical movements that led to failure, it has no inherent meaning that can be used to identify a meaningful root cause. Ultimately, the root cause of a mechanical failure can be found in the semantic failure that predicted its existence.

For example, if a system intends to use the first letter of a book’s name to place it on the shelf, then accepting a book with no name establishes the root cause of an inevitable failure in this intentionally designed world. The design semantics establish a constraint on the book name for the intention of the design to be successfully realized. 

However, the failure to respect the intention of the design doesn’t necessarily end in a mechanical failure. It can simply manifest as the world not realizing itself as intended. For example, the library manager intends to accept a book and place it in the basket. If this intention is not respected, then when it attempts to place the books on the shelf, it won't fail mechanically but it will result in the design not performing its primary functions. The design will simply see that there are no books in the basket. In this case, the root cause is a semantic failure to respect the intentions of the design. 

In the examples above, while one ended in a mechanical failure and the other did not, both failed at the semantic level by failing to realize the design's intentions. Failure to respect the intentions of the design establishes predictable failure modalities and defines precise resolution strategies. This means that by instrumenting the design semantics of each abstraction onto the implementation, the misalignment between reality and intention can be automatically understood and ultimately, this process automates debugging.
